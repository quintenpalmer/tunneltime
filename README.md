# Purpose

This will be an idle game to start with that
will be centered around dwarves digging for
resources and using those resources to improve
their tools and general capacity to dig more
resources.

# Installation

Install `rust` and `cargo` from your package
manager or from rustup:

https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs/#other-installation-methods

I don't dig the curl into bash, use your
discretion if you do follow that path.

# Running

From the root of this project, you can run the
server and the client as follows:

> cargo run --manifest-path src/tunneltimeserver/Cargo.toml

> cargo run --manifest-path src/tunneltimeclient/Cargo.toml
